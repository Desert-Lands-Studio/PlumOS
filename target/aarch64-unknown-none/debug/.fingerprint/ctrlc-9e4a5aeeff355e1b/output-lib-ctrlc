Examples:\n\n```\nstruct Something;\n\nimpl Something {} // ok!\n\n// or:\n\ntrait Foo {\n    type N;\n\n    fn bar(_: Self::N); // ok!\n}\n\n// or:\n\nfn foo<T>(x: T) {} // ok!\n```\n\nAnother case that causes this error is when a type is imported into a parent\nmodule. To fix this, you can follow the suggestion and use File directly or\n`use super::File;` which will import the types from the parent namespace. An\nexample that causes this error is below:\n\n```compile_fail,E0412\nuse std::fs::File;\n\nmod foo {\n    fn some_function(f: File) {}\n}\n```\n\n```\nuse std::fs::File;\n\nmod foo {\n    // either\n    use super::File;\n    // or\n    // use std::fs::File;\n    fn foo(f: File) {}\n}\n# fn main() {} // don't insert it for us; that'll break imports\n```\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"/home/jkfussy/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/ctrlc-3.5.1/src/lib.rs","byte_start":4424,"byte_end":4430,"line_start":129,"line_end":129,"column_start":66,"column_end":72,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"fn set_handler_inner<F>(mut user_handler: F, overwrite: bool) -> Result<(), Error>","highlight_start":66,"highlight_end":72}],"label":"not found in this scope","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"consider importing one of these items","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"/home/jkfussy/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/ctrlc-3.5.1/src/lib.rs","byte_start":1898,"byte_end":1898,"line_start":53,"line_end":53,"column_start":1,"column_end":1,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"pub use platform::Signal;","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":1}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"use core::fmt::Result;\n","suggestion_applicability":"MaybeIncorrect","expansion":null},{"file_name":"/home/jkfussy/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/ctrlc-3.5.1/src/lib.rs","byte_start":1898,"byte_end":1898,"line_start":53,"line_end":53,"column_start":1,"column_end":1,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"pub use platform::Signal;","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":1}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"use core::result::Result;\n","suggestion_applicability":"MaybeIncorrect","expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[1m\u001b[91merror[E0412]\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: cannot find type `Result` in this scope\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0m/home/jkfussy/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/ctrlc-3.5.1/src/lib.rs:129:66\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m129\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m fn set_handler_inner<F>(mut user_handler: F, overwrite: bool) -> Result<(), Error>\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                                                                  \u001b[1m\u001b[91m^^^^^^\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[91mnot found in this scope\u001b[0m\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96mhelp\u001b[0m: consider importing one of these items\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m 53\u001b[0m \u001b[92m+ use core::fmt::Result;\u001b[0m\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m 53\u001b[0m \u001b[92m+ use core::result::Result;\u001b[0m\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\n"}
